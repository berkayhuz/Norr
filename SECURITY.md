# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We support the **latest minor** of active major versions. Security fixes are released as patch versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Do not** open public issues for security problems. Instead:

1. Open a private report via **GitHub Security Advisories** (Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability) on the repository, **or**
2. Email the maintainers using the address in the repository profile.

Please include:
- Affected package and version(s)
- Environment and reproduction steps
- Impact assessment (confidentiality/integrity/availability)
- Optional: a minimal PoC

We aim to acknowledge valid reports within **72 hours** and provide a remediation plan or fix timeline.
